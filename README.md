# Deep-Learning-Tracker
Deep Learning Tracker to track the trajectory of the selected object. Undergraduate work.

This file (main.tex) is launched using XeLaTeX compiler.

## Annotation

Keywords: object tracking, quantization of weights, deep learning network, number of quantization levels, neurocomputer network.
 
The object of study is a network, which refers to the type of deep training of a neurocomputer network.

Purpose of work: research, development and modification of the existing algorithm for tracking a moving object on a set of images in real time. It was achieved by modifying the DLT deep trust network using a weighting quantization algorithm.

As a result, the number of quantization levels necessary for the quantization algorithm and acceptable tracking is obtained; An analysis of the effect of quantization on tracking an object is given.

### Prerequisites

I advise you to read the article on the [DLT](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5192-learning-a-deep-compact-image-representation-for-visual-tracking) tracker and the article on [the weighting coefficient quantization algorithm](http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&jrnid=pdm&paperid=676&option_lang=rus) before starting work.

Also, you can familiarize yourself with the [interesting work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6619156) of comparing trackers and with sequences designed specifically for such programs.
